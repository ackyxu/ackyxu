# Acky Xu

Hello!

I am Acky Xu, and currently a third-year student at The University of British Columbia Bachelor of Computer Science.  This is my second degree, with my previous degree being Bachelor of Commerce (Accounting and Business Technology Management), also at UBC.

Trying to combine both of my academic expereinces, I am interested with retrival of data, and processing the data into meaningful and actionable information.  This means most of my projects will involve some-sort of data retrieval and processing it to something that I can hopefully describe in details!

I am also an amateur photographer, and so you might find few project that I used as an excusing to use my camera!
